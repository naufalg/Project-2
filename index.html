          I'd always love Studio Ghibli, they always perceived as the maestro of
          fantasy-animated-movie that gives people
          lingering-tingling-after-movie-feeling. That perspective ended after
          I, ignorantly watched Grave of the Fireflies expecting served by
          astonishing visual, fantastic soundtrack, and graceful story. Well,
          all of them partly are true, BUT, still give me satisfying feeling
          even didn't fulfilled my expectation. Why? let me explain,

          Hotaru no Haka takes place in 1945, shortly after the end of World War
          II bombing. A teenage boy, Seita and his sister, Setsuko, struggling
          to survive, scavenging food in order to survive at all cost.
          Meanwhile, their mother passed away caused by bombing. Setsuko, who is
          just a child, not yet grasped the concept of passed away. His brother
          desperately convincing her that their mother is doing fine. (at this
          rate, it makes me thinking how safe and peaceful world nowadays, so
          save your complaints and love each other bois). In short, everything
          going to be dire state and storytelled in backward style, it was so
          subtle I did realized it only after the third times rewatching, how
          cool was that?<br />
